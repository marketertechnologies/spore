# SessionStart hook: load <project_root>/state.md into the coordinator's
# model context only.
#
# state.md is the coordinator's handover record; worker panes
# (engineers, reviewers) must not see it. Reviewer instance B in
# particular relies on "fresh eyes" - leaking the coordinator's
# narrative about reviewer A's verdict defeats the second-pass design.
#
# Gate: load only when SPORE_TASK_SLUG is unset (interactive shell,
# operator-spawned session) or equals "coordinator" (the kernel sets
# this in the coordinator pane env). Worker spawns set
# SPORE_TASK_SLUG to the actual task slug.
#
# Resolves <project_root> via `git rev-parse --git-common-dir` so
# the same canonical state.md is read from any worktree under the
# project. Falls back to cwd when not in a git repo so the hook is
# harmless outside spore.
